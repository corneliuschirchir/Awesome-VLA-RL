# Awesome-VLA-RL

With significant advances in **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)🍔** models based on large-scale imitation learning, integrating VLA with **Reinforcement Learning (RL)🥤** has emerged as a promising paradigm. This paradigm leverages the benefits of trial-and-error interactions with environments or pre-collected sub-optimal data.

This repository summarizes recent advances in the **VLA🍔 + RL🥤** paradigm and provides a classification of relevant works (offline RL training(without env.), online RL training(with env.), test-time RL(during deployment), and RL alignment).
